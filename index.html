    <h2>A funny story</h2>
    <p>
        I once went on vacation to America and when had to find our hotel we went the completely opposite way. We realized this by noticing that there was no living being within a 100m radius of us. We then had to walk the whole way back and 
        just hope we were going the right way because we didn't have any form of internet. Luckily we found our way by finding a waysign pointing us to the right direction. When we arrived we were so exhausted we didn't do anything that day.
    </p>
    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
    <p>
        Went the wrong way from our hotel and ended up having to walk the whole way back.
